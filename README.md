*** Admin username AND password is "admin" ***

<> Features <>

- Create and store Person type objects in an ArrayList
- Remove Person objects through a table accessible only to admin
- All information is saved in data.txt as it can be read from and written to using the FileHandler class
- Neat little GUI

<> Things I'd Like to Add/Change <>

- The actual test that calculates average reflex time and saves it (couldn't figure out timed events)
- Proper spacing between JFrame components
- Maybe make the application fullscreen
